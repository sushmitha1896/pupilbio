******Bioinformatics Assignment for Selection*****

Welcome to my bioinformatics assignment submission for the selection process. This project demonstrates my skills and expertise in bioinformatics, including data analysis, variant calling, and genomic visualization.

*********Project Overview************
This assignment involves analyzing genomic data to identify somatic mutations and perform various downstream analysis. The primary steps include:

Quality control of raw sequencing data

Adapter trimming and data cleaning

Sequence alignment to a reference genome

Variant calling to identify somatic mutations

*******Data visualization and interpretation**********

Software: The following software and tools are required to run the scripts:

FastQC

Cutadapt

BWA

VarScan2 using GALAXY server

Integrative genome viewer

**********Results*******
The results of the analysis, including quality control reports, alignment summaries, variant summaries, and visualizations, can be found here.

********Conclusion********
This project demonstrates my ability to perform comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, from raw data processing to variant identification and visualization. Thank you for considering my application for the bioinformatics position at PupilBio.
